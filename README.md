# Artificial-Intelligence-Deep-Q-Learning

Overview
===

The goal of this directory is to implement a Neural Network and develop an car AI that uses 
Deep Q Learning to learn how to drive around a race track while following the edge of the track

This solution is modeled after the solution to the self driving car problem presented in
[this course](https://www.udemy.com/artificial-intelligence-az/)
